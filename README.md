# mean_auth-firebase-jwt-token-

this is a learning purpose mern auth app in which we can see env files 
this projejct is not for publishing only for leanring purpose..
but in env fiels and firebase secret keys some keys have been removed for safety. so 
this is properly working mern auth application

important points:
1. this use mern stack and jwt with accesstoken system.
2. for google login it use firebase.
3. and dashboard is protected to prevent from unnecessary logins
